## Key Features

*   **Multilingual Voice Interaction:** Understands and responds in any language spoken by the user.
*   **Unique Character and Backstory Integration:** Each bot possesses a distinct character and backstory (e.g., a rude banker, a humble actor), influencing its responses.
*   **Context-Aware Responses:** Answers are tailored to the bot's personality and relevant to its role.
*   **Real-time Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Communication:** Provides a seamless voice interaction experience.
*   **Visual Cues:** Utilizes icons for voice recognition, language translation, and character representation to enhance user experience.

## How It Works

The React AI Voice Character Chatbot operates through the following steps:

**1. User Input & Language Detection:**

*   The user provides input either by speaking into their microphone or typing text.
*   If voice input is used, Speech-to-Text (STT) conversion (using the browser's Web Speech API) transcribes the audio into text.
*   Language detection identifies the language of the user's query.

**2. AI Processing & Character-Based Response:**

*   The user query (text and language information) is sent to the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21` model).
*   The query is enriched with a character prompt based on the user-defined character description, ensuring responses align with the chosen personality and backstory.
*   The Gemini model processes the enriched query and generates a contextually relevant response in the user's selected language.

**3. Output & Voice Synthesis:**

*   The AI's text response is displayed in the Chat UI.
*   The text response is then converted to speech using the ElevenLabs API for voice output.
*   Voice ID selection is dynamically determined based on the character description (e.g., male/female voices) to personalize the audio output further.
*   The voice response is played back to the user through audio playback in the browser.

## Architecture

The architecture of the React AI Voice Character Chatbot is designed for a streamlined web-based experience, leveraging browser capabilities and cloud services:

*   **Frontend (React.js):**  Handles user interface, user input (text and voice), displays chat messages, manages application state, and orchestrates interactions with backend services.
*   **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Utilizes the browser's built-in Web Speech API for real-time voice transcription.
*   **AI Model (Google Gemini API):** Employs the `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21` model from Google Gemini for natural language understanding, character-based response generation, and multilingual capabilities.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Integrates with the ElevenLabs API to convert AI text responses into high-quality, character-appropriate voice output.

## Scalability & Impact

The AI Assistant project is designed with scalability and efficiency in mind:

*   **Scalable Components:** Modular design allows for independent scaling of individual services based on demand.
